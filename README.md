# Text sentiment evaluation docker server
Using [DeepPavlov Sentiment analysis](https://demo.deeppavlov.ai/#/ru/sentiment)   
This server does not serves http requests, because i don't need that.   
You can define http server like [this](https://github.com/format37/codex_completions/blob/main/codex/server.py), if you need.
